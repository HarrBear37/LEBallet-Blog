    <h1>Weekly Report #3</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="indent">This week I have started to make a mock-up of the gallery page. I used the same color palette on this as the original.</p>

        <img src="img/GalSS1.png" alt="Gallery Photo"/>
    </figure>
    <p class="indent">I don't think I like the original color palette. For a ballet page, I think it should have lighter colors to represent the movement.</p>
    <p class="indent">I believe it involves JavaScript, but I want to make it so the image can be focused on when you click it. The rest of the page will blur, and the image will increase in size. During this, the reader can zoom in and out. This will be great for people with vision impairments.</p>
    <p class="indent">And I'll add an X but to have them leave. The info will go here. The text on the whole page makes it look bloated. </p>
