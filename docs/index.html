    <p class="indent">This week I have started to make a mock-up of the gallery page. I used the same color palette on this as the original.</p>

    </figure>
    <p class="indent">I don't think I like the original color palette. For a ballet page, I think it should have lighter colors to represent the movement.</p>
    <p class="indent">I believe it involves JavaScript, but I want to make it so the image can be focused on when you click it. The rest of the page will blur, and the image will increase in size. During this, the reader can zoom in and out. This will be great for people with vision impairments.</p>
    <p class="indent">And I'll add an X but to have them leave. The info will go here. The text on the whole page makes it look bloated. </p>

    <p class="indent">This week I met with Temi and Rashe, over Zoom, to discuss our plan moving forward. We assigned ourselves a page to work on. I will work on the gallery; Rashe will work on the Donation page; And Temi will work on the Home/About page. </p>
    <p class="indent">Also, we informed Rashe about our meeting with Elizabeth on the 16th. This meeting was helpful as we got a lot of insight. Here are some notes I took during the meeting and shared with the team:</p>

    <p class="indent">I tried some other color palettes on the website but didn't like them. We are going to come to a mutual agreement of the color palette. </p>

    <p class="indent">This week the team showed Elizabeth our concept designs for the website. We didn't code these designs but used digital illustrator. As a team, we haven't come up with final palette but are going to use muted colors. </p>
    <p class="indent">Elizabeth was satisfied with each of our mockups. She believes out individual styles with mesh together nicely. Here are the three mockups I made:</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/LEBallet_top.png" alt="Top of the Gallery"/>
    </figure>
    <p class="indent">A great introduction for the reader. It gets the point across without being overwhelming. I added the arrow at the bottom to indicate there is more.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/LEBallet_grid.png" alt="Some of the images in the gallery"/>
    </figure>
    <p class="indent">I wanted to keep it simple. Some of my early designs made the background too noisy. In the end, the mono-colored background looked the best.</p>
    <p class="indent">I'm going to add <code>::hover</code> to the images. It will give them a border to let the reader know it can be selected.</p>
    <figure>
        <img src="img/LEBallet_select.png" alt="Image that is selected"/>
    </figure>
    <p class="indent">This turned out mostly like I wanted it to. I might darken the background to make the image pop. It may just be this image, but I feel like it blends in. For this one, and the others, the UI is not finished. </p>
