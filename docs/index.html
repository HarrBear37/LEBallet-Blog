    <p class="indent">This week I have started to make a mock-up of the gallery page. I used the same color palette on this as the original.</p>

    <p class="indent">I don't think I like the original color palette. For a ballet page, I think it should have lighter colors to represent the movement.</p>
    <p class="indent">I believe it involves JavaScript, but I want to make it so the image can be focused on when you click it. The rest of the page will blur, and the image will increase in size. During this, the reader can zoom in and out. This will be great for people with vision impairments.</p>
    <p class="indent">And I'll add an X but to have them leave. The info will go here. The text on the whole page makes it look bloated. </p>

    <p class="indent">This week I met with Temi and Rashe, over Zoom, to discuss our plan moving forward. We assigned ourselves a page to work on. I will work on the gallery; Rashe will work on the Donation page; And Temi will work on the Home/About page. </p>
    <p class="indent">Also, we informed Rashe about our meeting with Elizabeth on the 16th. This meeting was helpful as we got a lot of insight. Here are some notes I took during the meeting and shared with the team:</p>

    <p class="indent">I tried some other color palettes on the website but didn't like them. We are going to come to a mutual agreement of the color palette. </p>
